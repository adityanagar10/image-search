Hi, This is *Aditya* and this is my react based web-app. The main functionality of this app is that it's a picture galary app.

<h1>What does it do: </h1>
  1. It provides a selection of random images every time the website is loaded.<br>
  2. It provides a search functionality, which returns the images of the said search term.<br>
  3. It returns important analytics like name of photographer, views, likes and downloads.<br>
<h1>Technology used: </h1>
  1.React Js <br>
  2.Tailwind CSS <br>
  3.npm <br>


<h1><b>IMPORTANT!!<b></h1>
  <p>Due to some technical errors, my WebApp was unable to load but I have attached screenshots and screenrecords below: </p>
